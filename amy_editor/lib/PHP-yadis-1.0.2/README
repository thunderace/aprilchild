PHP Yadis
---------

This is the PHP Yadis library by JanRain, Inc.  You can visit our
website for more information about this package and other Yadis
implementations and tools:

INSTALLATION
============

You will need PHP 4.3.0 or greater to use this library.  We have
tested the library on PHP 4.3.0, 4.4.1, and 5.1.1.

Follow these steps:

1. Install and enable the CURL extension if possible.  This is
   optional.

2. Use the PEAR installer to install the package.  To use the PEAR
   installer, run this command from the package directory:

   # pear install package.xml

   If your PEAR version is sufficiently new, you can run this instead:

   # pear install package2.xml

   If the PEAR installer isn't available, you can copy the Services/
   directory into your PHP include path.

USING THE API
=============

The best way to get started using the API is to take a look at the
Services_Yadis_Yadis class documentation which can be found in
Services/Yadis/Yadis.php.  The documentation found there details the
Yadis discovery process using this API.
